How to mix MongoDB with Rails 2.1 for gandi.net hpp.io "the happy hippo", this essentially for Penny v4.0, only available on Chrome OS, anyone with Chrome and OpenGL (WebGL) enabled. And the base hpp.io website, The Happy Hippo!

We are creating a web app based on Penelope. Remember Penny v2.0 each archetype could hold a reference to another archetype. In Swift this was optionals. In MongoD this is a relational database. Through SSH portals we can run these systems on 24 core processor. Through native application we retrieve access to a parallel processing chip, albeit Nvidia GTX 560ti, essentially 1 gigaflop calculations per device codec. These A/V codecs can be programmed through use of OpenGL -> Opengles 3.0; 

Very powerful stuff, only what really is there to do with all this power? Imagine a chess app. It plays a game. The game is an object. Each move holds reference to many games played down the same route. Professional chess players of the highest caliber know this. It isn't about strategy, and optimizations, it IS ABOUT MEMORIZATION!!!

In SWIFT optionals(new Archetype, catch nil ref in try loops) presents a huge flaw. What to do if two objects hold nil reference of an object they need. This was solved through closure({return when(you).voyageToWalk(theDog(you))}()) As Rails solves a similar problem with Mongo. Are you ready for Ruby on Rails? Go over to Gandi.net now! Websites as low as $60. $30 domain registration plus half off domain hosting fees. S sized Simple Hosting solution. Select Create an Instance, choose closest server location. Instance Family set to Ruby / mongoDB (beta). 

Let's break down the closure steps into digestable bits:

Closure takes an argument, `closure(arg)`

the argument is unknown, We know whatever calls closure holds reference to itself, you. So we return what to do with you when. => `closure({return when(you)})` and we forgot the () to close it {}(call it) => `closure({return when(you)}())`

Now do something interesting, `closure({return when(you).voyageToChase()}())`

PROBLEM, ERROR ===>>> voyageToChase missing 1st arg!

Fix, `closure({return when(you).voyageToChase(arg)}())` when the only arg we hold is you(self).

ERROR ===>>> no known method voyageToChase(param you) accepts 1st parameter of type you.

Solution, cast yourself as Dog, `func tailOfDog(arg: you) ->  val: Dog` function tailOfDog returns value of type Dog and takes 1st arg of type you. => `closure({return when(you).voyageToChase(TailOfDogma(you))}())`

~Note, in Swift an optional has to be unwrapped. Assuming you are an archetype(aka optional) i.e. `var you? = whoAreYou()` then you need to be unwrapped when called. `closure({return when(you?).voyageToChase(theTaleOfDogma(you?))}())`

No, no, no, the optionals have to be unwrapped when called, not when set. That is to say the wrappers take args of type optional. ==> `closure({return when(you)?.voyageToChase(theTailOfDogma(you))}())`

Alas:=>  `try {closingIn({return when(you)?.voyageToChess(theTaleOfDogma())}())} catch {var you? = whoAreYou()}` (self) is implied => ()

Now the Tale of Dogma holds a reference to you, who ever you are.

##Now in Mongo wrapped in Rails for chess example

###Chess Model

Self is a game. Chess. You are one move. One move, this move need not hold reference to other moves that are unobtainable from this move. At any time z the number of moves is finite. Hence, continuous time t moves into finite space Z. Z is a complex space. That is to say, z = x + iy, of a harmonic system, u(x,y) + v(x,y) = 0. Hence if u''!=0 or v''!=0 then v''=f(u''), u holds reference to v. 

This is important as  z is mapped from t (continuous time) hence, u(t,s) + v(t,s) also must equal zero! As x is a representation of real time, and y only possible in multidimensional space.

The number of chess games explodes. 64 squares, 16 pieces each, if each piece averages 2 or 3 possible moves => 16(2.3) after each move n, you(n) = n^(16(2.3)), however you at time n only hold 32 to 48 possible moves approximately. And this number decreases with time, as chess is a stable system. Possible chess games explode which make chess appear unstable, but there is a finite number of chess games. No infinite loops in chess. Chess has a loop breaker, if the same position is reached 3 times the games a draw. All games end, and have been played in computational space => chess is a solved game. 

So if chess is a stable system as n increases the number of possible moves decreases. you(n) = e^-Llamda(m), where m = n^16(2.3), anyway bottom line as n -> inifinity, you(n) -> 0, checkMate or draw!

Now that we have defined chess in turns of a sampled signal (z) from a continuous wave (t,s) we can began looking at the sample increments in terms of particles. Implementing a fractal brownian motion system (Einstein used these to calculate avacado's #) set each move to a pixel in julia fractal space. In fractal space the inverse itterative function blows up, f(z) = {+,-}.sqrt(z-c), where C is the constant from current position. Where in chess plus would be the closest point where u'(x,y)=0 and minus v'(x,y)=0.
