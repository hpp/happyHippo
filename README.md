How to mix MongoDB with Rails 2.1 for gandi.net hpp.io "the happy hippo"

We are creating a web app based on Penelope. Remember Penny v2.0 each archetype could hold a reference to another archetype. In Swift this was optionals. In MongoD this is a relational data base. Through SSH portals we can run these systems on 24 core processor. Through native application we retrieve access to a parallel processing chip, albeit Nvidia GTX 560ti, essentially 1 gigaflop calculations per device codec. These A/V codecs can be programmed through use of OpenGL -> Opengles 3.0; 

Very powerful stuff, only what really is there to do with all this power? Imagine a chess app. It plays a game. The game is an object. Each move holds reference to many games played down the same route. Professional chess players of the highest caliber know this. It isn't about strategy, and optimizations, it IS ABOUT MEMORIZATION!!!

In SWIFT optional present a huge flaw. What to do if two objects didn't hold reference of an object they needed. This was solved through closure().when().you().voyage().to.walk().theDog() In Rails this is solved with Mongo
